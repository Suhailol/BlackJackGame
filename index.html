        <p id="terms">In 21 Blackjack, the objective is to beat the dealer by getting a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. Each player is dealt two cards, and they can choose to "hit" and receive additional cards to improve their hand, or "stand" and keep their current hand. Face cards are worth 10, aces can be worth 1 or 11, and all other cards are worth their face value. The player must make this decision based on their own hand and the dealer's up card. Whoever has the highest hand value without going over 21 wins.</p>
